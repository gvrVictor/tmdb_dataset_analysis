# tmdb_dataset_analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze **The Movie Database** provided by Kaggle, which can be downloaded from [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv) or by downloading this repository, file name `tmdb-movies.csv`.

There are 2 *questions* that the Py notebook tries to answer:
> **Q1**: Which genres are most popular from year to year?
> 
> **Q2**: What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenue?

To answer the posed questions, the dataset will go through:
> - data wrangling
>
> - data cleaning
>
> - exploratory data analysis

*I have to note that the above mentioned steps are not linear, it's more like a feedback loop, you perform 1-2 steps at a time, check the results and if needed go back and adapt the script until the desired results are achieved.*

And finally, the **conclusion** phase, where based on all the plots, analysis, correlation matrix the answers to the posed questions are redacted.
